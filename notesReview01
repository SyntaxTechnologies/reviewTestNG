Data driven Testing:

@DataProvider-->

Step1:
create a mehtod that returns a 2D array


listeners---->
listeners are compnent of testNg and they keep track of all the events during execution
like

testcase started
test case passed
test case failed
test cases skipped

and whenever any of these event occurs it gives us the control to
run a particular set of code or logic of our own choice



parallel execution:
execution of test cases at the same time
it is much faster
